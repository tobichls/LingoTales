## Technologies Used

| Technology Used               | Purpose                           |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| `Claude LLM`                  | Generating story panels           |
| `Python` & `Flask`            | Backend server handling           |
| `Google Cloud Translation API`| Language translation              |
| `React.js`                    | Frontend web interface            |

## Code Structure

The web interface is built with React for a smooth user experience. `App.jsx` is the main hub where top level data is stored for use in API calls. The `MultiStepForm` component collects user data for setting up the story. Responses from the backend are stored in state and displayed. `frontend/index.html`: This HTML file is the main page of the frontend application.

`api/api.py`: This Python file contains the init function which sets up the API key for either the GPT or Claude backend.

`api/main.py`: This file manages backend activities of the web application such as GET, POST and calling the LLM APIs.
