## Why Language Learning Matters
"**England has a language education crisis**: fewer people are studying languages at school and university language programmes are closing." 

<br> - Becky MuradÃ¡s-Taylor, *"Undergraduate language programmes in England: A widening participation crisis"*

## What is LingoTales?
[IMAGE HERE] <br>
Stories are initially told in English (or the user's native tongue), and they can then choose from a series of options presented in their chosen language. The next scene in the story is generated from the user's response.

<br>

## Features
[EXAMPLE SCREENSHOT HERE] <br>
### User influences story direction.
Users are given multiple choices to choose how the story progresses after each scene.
<br>[EXAMPLE SCREENSHOT HERE] <br>
### Intuition based learning
Users utilize the context of the story to organically learn what their choices mean instead of being explicitly taught definitions.
<br>[EXAMPLE SCREENSHOT HERE] <br>
